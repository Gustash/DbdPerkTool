## Instructions
Download the latest release [here](https://packs.dbdicontoolbox.com/Dead-By-Daylight-Icon-Toolbox-Latest.exe). If you have trouble with the .exe installer, try the .msi version [here](https://packs.dbdicontoolbox.com/Dead-By-Daylight-Icon-Toolbox-Latest.msi).

## Changelog
You can see the latest release information [here](https://github.com/nrcrast/dbdperktool/releases/latest).

## Why is Windows complaining?

The license to sign a Windows desktop application costs \$400 a year. If the community is willing to front the money, I'll pay for it. Otherwise I've made the repo open source so you can be sure I'm not up to any funny business.
